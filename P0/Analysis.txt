Project: Unscramble Computer Science Problems.

Analysis:

0. Task0:
- To fetch first and last record of a `list` in Python, directly access them by
respective index of 0 and -1
- Complexity: O(1)

1. Task1:
- This task involves in iterating over the entire list of input records.
- Complexity: O(n)

2. Task2:
- This task requires iterating over the entire list of input call records.
- Complexity: O(n)

3. Task3:
- This task requires iterating over the entire list of input call records.
- Above iteration requires O(n) complexity.
- But, we need to sort the output in lexciographic order using Python's 
list.sorted() method.
- Python list.sorted() has the complexity of O(n log n) complexity.
- Complexity: O(n log n)

4. Task4:
- This task requires iterating over the entire list of input call records.
- Above iteration requires O(n) complexity.
- But, we need to sort the output in lexciographic order using Python's 
list.sorted() method.
- Python list.sorted() has the complexity of O(n log n) complexity.
- Complexity: O(n log n)
